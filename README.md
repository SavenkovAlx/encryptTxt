## encryptTxt

# Task: 
The program allows you to open a file with text data and encrypt them with a cipher of the student's choice, provided it is impossible to decrypt by processing character statistics. Encrypted data is saved in a new file. It is possible to perform the task in conjunction with the creation of a second program that will decrypt the data.
The program must use a graphical interface (GUI), respond to user errors by displaying appropriate messages (entering incorrect data, choosing an incorrect file type, etc.)

# Implementation: 
Using the xorg encryption algorithm and the tkinter GUI library
